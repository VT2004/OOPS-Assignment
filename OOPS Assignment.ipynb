Object: An instance of a class. Objects are the actual data created using the class definition, representing real-world entities.\n","\n","Example: A Car object like my_car = Car().\n","\n","3. Encapsulation: The bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class, and restricting access to some components. It hides the internal details and shows only necessary parts.\n","\n","Example: Using private variables in a class to prevent direct access.\n","\n","4. Inheritance: A mechanism where one class (child/subclass) inherits attributes and methods from another class (parent/superclass), promoting code reusability.\n","\n","Example: A SportsCar class inheriting from the Car class.\n","\n","5.
